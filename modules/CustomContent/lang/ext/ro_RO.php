<p>This module, in conjunction with the FrontEndUsers module allows you to create a page that will look different depending upon the person that looks at it.  You can specify different content for certain users, or members of a certain group.</p>
<p><b>Note 1:</b> Creating logic in a page that could potentially result in different output for each request, you should ensure that that page will not be cached.  This is accomplished by ensuring that the &amp;quote;cachable&amp;quote; tag is cleared on the page before submitting or applying</p>
<p><b>Note 2:</b> If the smarty logic is in your template, you need to ensure that each page that uses that template is not cachable</p>
<h3>How Do I Use It</h3>
<pre>
{if $customcontent_loggedin > 0}
  Welcome <b>{$customcontent_loginname}</b><br/>
{else}
  <h1>You are not authorized to view this data</h1>
{/if}
</pre>
<br/>
<p>Or you can use the $ccuser variable for more advanced, and easier to read testing</p>
<pre>
{if $ccuser->memberof(&#039;members&#039;) &amp;&amp; $ccuser->ipmatches(&#039;192.168.0.0/24&#039;)}
Welcome logged in local member
{elseif $ccuser->memberof(&#039;members&#039;)}
Welcome logged in member
{elseif $ccuser->loggedin()}
Welcome user from some other group
{else}
Anonymous user
{/if}
</pre>
<br/>
<h4>Available variables:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><em>ccuser</em> - An object with convenience functions for testing.</p>
<p>This object contains some convenience methods for performing more advanced customcontent logic, or for making your template look a little bit better. The available methods are:</p>
  <ul>
<li><em>$ccuser->groups()</em> - outputs a list of the users member groups</li>
<li><em>$ccuser->memberof(&#039;group&#039;)</em> - outputs a boolean if the user is indeed a member of this group.  This function will also accept a comma separated list of group names.</li>
<li><em>$ccuser->loggedin()</em> - outputs a boolean if the user is loggedin</li>
<li><em>$ccuser->username()</em> - outputs the username of the currently logged in user.</li>
<li><em>$ccuser->property(&#039;propertyname&#039;)</em> - outputs the value of the property for the currently logged in user.</li>
<li><em>$ccuser->ipmatches($ranges)</em> - outputs a boolean if the users ip address matches one of the comma separated ip ranges.  Accepts ranges like ###.###.###.###/## i.e: 192.168.0.0/24</li>
  </ul>
<br/>
</li>
<li><p><em>customcontent_ip</em> - The remote IP address</p></li>
<li><p><em>customcontent_loggedin</em> - An integer indicating the userid if the current logged in user.  This variable may exist, but have no value if the user is not logged in.</p></li>
<li><p><em>customcontent_loginname</em> - The name of the currently logged in user</p></li>
<li><p><em>customcontent_groupcount</em> - A count of the number of groups this user is a member of</p></li>
<li><p><em>customcontent_groups</em> - A string containing the group names of all member groups</p></li>
<li><p><em>customcontent_memberof_*</em> - A series of boolean variables indicating group membership.  i.e.: customcontent_memberof_staff, customcontent_memberof_users, etc.  No variables are defined for groups that this user is not a member of.</p></li>
</ul>
